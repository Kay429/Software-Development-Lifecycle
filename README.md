How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

* It is important to consider everything that the customer and users ask for, because although they will directly say what the program needs to do for them, there are other hidden needs that are only implied. Creating User Stories is helpful for finding these hidden needs, breaking up large tasks into smaller ones, and managing tasks. User Stories can be organized and prioritized in order to ensure the customer gets the most important features. They can help me stay focused with a clear vision of what I am creating. They are also easy to change, combine, and split up into smaller user stories, so I can adapt to a customer's needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

* I would like to improve at developing programs incrementally. Usually, I write up a plan and some pseudocode, then create the entire program, fixing whatever problems arise as I go. This has, of course, gotten harder as the programs I create become more complicated with more moving parts. If I instead created a high-level plan of all my program's main components and broke that plan into iterations, I think I would be more focused and productive. It can be difficult to improve when all I'm thinking about is the next tasks I have to complete, so I would also like to include more retrospective time in my schedule. I have applied this to some of my personal projects and found that taking time to reflect on my work usually yields a lot of information that I may not have gained otherwise.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

 * A good team member is honest, open, and dedicated. They are willing to tell the truth, even if it is embarrassing or they fear the consequences of speaking up. Any impediments to the team's success need to be talked about, not hidden. A good team member shares their thoughts and ideas with the group, even if they don't seem great. Innovation comes from ideas like these, and a good team member not only openly shares their ideas, they also share their opinions on the ideas of others, creating an environment in which the team can discuss and grow. A good team member is committed to the success of the project and their team, and will always put out the best effort they can.
